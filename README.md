# 42Madrid - CPPs

C++ Practice exercises 
The CPP piscine consists of 10 different modules that serve as an introduction to the C++ language. Each module contains a series of independent exercises that primarily introduce us to object-oriented programming (OOP). Each exercise includes a Makefile with which to compile and test the programs.
